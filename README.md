# Digital_watermarking
This digital watermark scheme works to color image.
Digital watermarking is a kind of data hiding technique ,recently several researcher use it to protect copyright or ownership.
In digital watermarking research field, watermark always an invisible watermark.  
For example:  
 <img src="https://github.com/parkmftsai/Digital_watermarking/blob/master/watermarking/origenal_image/OMG_Goldhill_RGB_n.bmp" width = "300" height = "300" alt="origenal_image" align=left />
  <img src="https://github.com/parkmftsai/digital_watermarking/blob/master/watermarking/kuas.jpg" width = "300" height = "300" alt="watermark" align=center/>  
  Clockwise from  left: "Origenal_image" and "Watermark"

Of course, our goal is hiding watermark to original image, it can divide into two phases, embedding and extracting.<br >
Embedding is meaning we can use a special scheme (like LSB), let watermark hind to original image, and output one image what processed after embedding, this image, we call that covered image.<br >
For example:  
<img src="https://github.com/parkmftsai/digital_watermarking/blob/master/watermarking/cover_image/Hillnew.bmp" width = "300" height = "300" alt="cover_image" align=center />

Note:
a best embedding scheme can product Covered image what almost like the original image.<br >

Extracting is meaning we can use the scheme opposite of embedding, it can extract the watermark from cover image. <br >

If you want to know detail about our scheme , you can read our paper and run our source code<br >
have fun~~~~^_^<br >
